## Additional info about this project:
- To test pagination, type 'JavaScript' in a search, only this word include more than 10 'records'
- Some images might not fit its description, because I have around 100 records in JSON and it would be pretty hard to "connect all the dots"
- Some links might not direct where it's supposed to be, ex. "Privacy policy" , "Archive" and so on, 
their implementation were not part of the requirements, there were created just for the sake of UI/UX
- There might be some other part of the app that might not work as you might expect, they are just part of the UI,
so please do not them.
- Enjoy the project, hope I will like it :)
